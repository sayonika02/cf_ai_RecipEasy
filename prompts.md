### Prompt 1
> What is a Cloudflare Worker with Wrangler and how can I enable Workers AI and Durable Objects in my project?

### Prompt 2
> I’m getting an error: “The receiving Durable Object does not support RPC, because its class was not declared with extends DurableObject.” I’ve already defined my class and bindings

### Prompt 3
> Website loads but is unable to display the results from the model, How can I debug whether the issue is in the API response handling or the JSON transfer between the Worker and UI?
